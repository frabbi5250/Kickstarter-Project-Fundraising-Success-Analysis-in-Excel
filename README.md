Using technical analysis in excel to analyze fundraising outcomes, and efforts from 2014-2018

# Kickstarting with Excel

I. Overview of the Project/Purpose

    The overview of this project was to analyze data, and conclude the following results based on several different outcomes. The following outcomes being discussed were based upon the following:successful, failure, or canceled. In order to understand why such outcomes were of the following three that were mentioned, it is significant filter out the amounts which is essential for making conclusions. 

    The purpose of the project was to visualize campaign outcomes based on launch dates ad funding goals

II. Analysis and Challenges
   In order to complete the project, it was essential to review module 1 and take notes on the different functions being used in order to get the data needed to create charts. One of the challenges of completing the assignment was inserting pivot tables. The purpose of pivot tables first of all, are to condense data into a summary to deliver information. Understanding what is filtered, and what will the outcome be displayed as is crucial. In order to overcome this challenge, I have redone the module that includes the following videos on how to complete this part of the project. To complete the following charts which conclude the following information, additional columns needed to be created in order to separate the parent category and subcategory of outcomes. To summarize the success, failure, and cancellation of outcomes in each categories for different years, it was essential to use the "=year()." The other part of the project involving finding on the percentages of success, failure, and cancellation of "Outcomes Based on Goals," the "countifs()" function was used to populate the following outcomes as well as indicating which category the outcomes summarize. 
    
III. Results

    -   What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
    The rate of success tends to drop after June and July whereas the rate of failures tend to decrease whenever success rate increases. 

    - What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
    The number of failures increase whereas the success decreases which may end up concluding facts regarding the idea that the outcomes of plays are seen not as effective as the other outcomes. 

    - What are some limitations of this dataset?
    Limitations include not including the average of each categories along with the goals and outcomes. It would be difficult to understand the outcomes of the other following categories if there are no important information such as collecting the average of each outcomes. 
    - What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
    Creating bar graphs would be a great idea after taking the average of outcomes and goals per each category. Creating bar graphs would be needed for sucess, for failure, and for cancellation in order to compare and contrast the funding results between outcomes.
